# Financial-Institute-Complaint-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project is a Tableau-based data visualization dashboard designed to analyze and monitor consumer complaints filed against various financial institutions. It provides regulators, corporate analysts, and consumer advocates with insights into customer service issues, company performance in handling disputes, and overall trends in the financial sector. The dashboard focuses on operational efficiency and customer satisfaction metrics.
Primary Objectives:
•	Quantify the total volume of complaints and their outcomes (disputed vs. non-disputed).
•	Measure the timeliness of company responses to consumer complaints.
•	Identify the financial institutions with the highest complaint volumes.
•	Categorize and rank the most frequently reported issues by consumers.
•	Analyze geographical trends in complaint filings across different states.

2. KPI Description (Summary Metrics)
The dashboard provides high-level summary metrics that capture the scale and nature of the complaints:
•	Total Complaints: The dataset contains 70,813 total complaints (37,984 Disputed + 32,829 Non-Disputed).
•	Disputed vs Non-Disputed: Shows that 37,984 complaints were disputed by consumers, while 32,829 were not, indicating a significant rate of consumer dissatisfaction with initial responses.
•	Timely Response: A large majority of complaints received a timely response, with only a small fraction (e.g., 1,076) not responded to on time.
•	% Monetary Relief: A key metric showing the percentage of cases where the resolution involved financial compensation for the consumer.

3. Chart & Visualization Description
1. Top Bank By Complaints (Horizontal Bar Chart)
•	Description: A bar chart ranking financial companies (e.g., Bank of America, Capital One, Synchrony Financial) by the total volume of complaints received.
•	Purpose: To quickly identify which institutions have the highest number of customer issues, potentially indicating broader service problems.
2. Complaint Received Over Months (Line/Area Chart)
•	Description: A timeline chart showing the number of complaints received each month, revealing peaks and troughs.
•	Purpose: To identify seasonal trends, spikes following specific events, or the overall growth/decline in complaint volume over time.
3. Top Issues (Horizontal Bar Chart)
•	Description: A chart categorizing and ranking the most common complaint reasons, such as "Billing disputes," "Identity theft / fraud / Employs," and "APR or interest rate" issues.
•	Purpose: To understand the most pervasive problems consumers face, allowing institutions to prioritize fixes and regulatory bodies to focus oversight.
4. Complaints By State (Choropleth Map)
•	Description: A map of the United States colored based on the number of complaints originating from each state.
•	Purpose: To visualize geographical concentrations of complaints, which could be influenced by state-specific laws, regional bank prevalence, or demographic factors.
5. Bottom Bank By Response Days (Horizontal Bar Chart)
•	Description: A chart listing the companies with the slowest average response times to complaints (e.g., "Welcome Acquisition Group").
•	Purpose: To highlight operational inefficiencies and hold specific institutions accountable for poor responsiveness, a key consumer protection metric.

4. Filters Description
The dashboard includes interactive filters to customize the view, likely including:
•	Company: Filter to view data for a specific financial institution.
•	Issue: Filter by type of complaint (e.g., only see "Billing disputes").
•	State: Filter to analyze complaints from a specific geographical area.
•	Date Range: Filter to focus on a specific time period.

5. Conclusion & Insights
This dashboard effectively highlights critical pain points in the consumer-financial institution relationship.
Key Conclusions:
1.	High Dispute Rate: The near 50/50 split between disputed and non-disputed complaints suggests that initial resolutions are often unsatisfactory, necessitating further escalation.
2.	Identifiable Problem Areas: A handful of major banks (Bank of America, Capital One) account for a significant portion of all complaints, indicating where focused improvement efforts are needed.
3.	Common Issues: Billing disputes and fraud-related issues are top concerns, pointing to critical areas for process improvement and customer education.
4.	Operational Inconsistency: While most responses are timely, the "Bottom Bank" list reveals significant outliers with very slow response times, highlighting compliance risks.
5.	Geographical Trends: Complaint volume is not evenly distributed, with certain states generating more complaints, which could be targeted for better consumer support resources.
In summary, the dashboard reveals a sector where consumer dissatisfaction is significant and pinpointable. It provides a clear roadmap for institutions to improve specific products (credit cards, with billing issues) and operational processes (response time).
